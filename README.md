# Pycasso-Python-Art-Creator
Written by Ben Woodfield
Uses Python and Pygame to create random (and somewhat artistic) images

Pygame Art Creator

Turn Python into an artist by giving it complete control over the 
drawing.
Using random you can make all sorts of patterns using rectangles and circles.
Sometimes it can appear a bit cluttered but if you play with the values -
and run it a few times you will see some cool looking results

See lines 24 and 25 in the code to edit the colors of the circles using RGB values
See line 18 to change the value for the amount of shapes drawn


This is the very first version of this program.
Most of my improvement ideas involve the user being able to select
different options for the output.

TO DO LIST:


    Picture frame display
    Choice of frames
    A menu system:
    {Change colours,
    Change shapes (add or remove rectangles/circles),
    Change volume of shapes,
    Change Thickness of outline for a shape,
    Save to a directory as an image / print screen / screenshot}
    



You are welcome to contribute ideas or code 0 this is only the first and very basic version!
