# Pycasso-Python-Art-Creator
Uses Python and Pygame to create random (and somewhat artistic) images

Pygame Art Creator

Turn Python into an artist by giving it complete control over the 
drawing.
Using random you can make all sorts of patterns using rectangles and circles.
Sometimes it can appear a bit cluttered but if you play with the values -
and run it a few times you will see some cool looking results

See lines 24 and 25 in the code to edit the colors of the circles using RGB values
See line 18 to change the value for the amount of shapes drawn


This is the very first attempt or version of this.
I hope to add the following over time:

A Picture Frame Background to display image
A choice of picture frames
A menu system:

    Change colours
    Change shapes (add or remove rectangles/circles)
    Change volume of shapes
    Change Thickness of outline for a shape
    Save to a directory as an image / print screen / screenshot
    
You are welcome to contribute ideas or code 0 this is only the first and very basic version!
